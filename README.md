# RawsViewer

I intend to write small application for viewing raws (scanned pages containing Japanese/Chinese/etc text).

Currently I'm using IrfanView for such purposes but it has few limitations. 
On example, it has problems with file paths containing Japanese symbols.

Also, I have few ideas I would like to implement in this utility.
And of course, I want to play with JavaFX

Currently implemented stuff:

- Files are opened by drag'n'drop from file manager
- Images can be scaled to some degree
